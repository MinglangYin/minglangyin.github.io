- I am Minglang Yin. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, Brown University. I am working with and advised by [Prof. George Em Karniadakis](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis).

- My research interests are on scientific machine learning and its applications on biomechanics, scientific machine learning, computational mechanics, and uncertainty quantification.
