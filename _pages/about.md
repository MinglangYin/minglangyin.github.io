- I am Minglang Yin. I am a Postdoc Fellow in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University. I am working with [Prof.Natalia Traynova](http://www.trayanovalab.org/) on developing AI models for addressing needs in cardiac electrophysiology.

- My research interests are on developing AI and computational models to address pressing needs in clinical pipelines and to elucidate disease mechanisms. I am also interested in AI, cardiovascular biomechanics, computational mechanics, and uncertainty quantification.
