- I am Minglang Yin. I am a Postdoc Fellow in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University. I am working with [Prof.Natalia Traynova](http://www.trayanovalab.org/) on developing machine learning models for cardiovascular diseases. I finished my Ph.D. degree with [Prof. George Em Karniadakis](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis) and the title of my thesis is Hybrid Computational-Machine Learning Models with Uncertainty Quantification for Aortic Dissection.

- My research interests are on developing mechanistic models and scientific machine learning for diagnosis and prognosis of diverse cardiovascular diseases. I am also interested in cardiovascular biomechanics, computational mechanics, and uncertainty quantification.
